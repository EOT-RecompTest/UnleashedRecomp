# EdgeOfTime Runtime Test

This directory contains a copy of the current runtime used by Unleashed Recompiled.
It can serve as a starting point for integrating XenonRecomp output from
*Spider-Man: Edge of Time*.

All files under `EdgeOfTimeRuntime` mirror the structure of the runtime inside the
main repository. They are intended for experimentation when bringing up a PC
runtime for Edge of Time.
